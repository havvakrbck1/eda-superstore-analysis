# 🛍️ EDA on Superstore Sales Data

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sample retail dataset ("Superstore") to uncover insights about sales, profits, and product performance.

## 📊 Overview

The analysis is performed using **Python**, leveraging libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data manipulation and visualization.

The goals of this project:

- Understand sales distribution and trends
- Analyze product categories and their contribution to revenue
- Identify potential issues or outliers in the data
- Build a strong foundation for future machine learning tasks

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a sample sales file typically used in business intelligence training. It includes:

- Order ID, Product, Category, Sub-Category
- Sales, Quantity, Profit, Discount
- Customer and regional information

📌 Note: The original dataset was in Excel format and was converted to `.csv` for easier processing.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📉 Key Visualizations

- Sales distribution histograms
- Box plots per product category
- Correlation analysis
- Average price per sale unit

## 🧼 Data Cleaning

- Checked for null values and data types
- Added new columns (e.g., average price per sale)
- Filtered and summarized data by category and sub-category

## 📌 How to Run
